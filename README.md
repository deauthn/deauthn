## About Me
I consider myself to be rather awkward, but I embrace it. Currently, I am a British student pursuing college courses in Information Technology, with the aspiration of becoming a red teamer ☠️ while simultaneously honing my coding skills. Though I am at the beginning of my learning journey, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge. Also I use Arch btw...
